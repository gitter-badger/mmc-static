    Dear {{preferred}},&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    Congratulations on your acceptance into the University of Notre Dame Executive MBA program. The Admissions Committee of the Mendoza College of Business has approved your application for the Chicago Executive MBA Program - Class of 2017. On behalf of the faculty of the Mendoza College of Business, I want to thank you for your interest in enrolling in this graduate level course and welcome you to the University.<br />
    <br />
    We are aware of the considerable sacrifice that you will be making over the 17-month program undertaking this rigorous course of study. We are certain, however, that you will enjoy the opportunities for learning and the association with the faculty and other members of your class. Your graduation will be a significant achievement that will benefit you for a lifetime.<br />
    <br />
    As part of your preparation, we are offering access to a pre-program prep course called MBA Math (www.mbamath.com). We are strongly recommending that you complete the 40 hour on-line tutorial prior to the start of classes in January. This is a quantitative refresher that covers advanced Excel, College Algebra, Economics, Accounting and Statistics. If you would like to receive access and log-in information, please send an email to the Admissions Team at emba.business@nd.edu. The information will be provided via email once your confirmation deposit is received. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    To confirm your enrollment in our program, please remit your non-refundable confirmation fee of $2,500.00 (check or money order only, made payable to the University of Notre Dame) within 14 days of the date of this letter. For your information, your confirmation fee will be credited to your first term tuition. Please also complete the enclosed Confirmation Form, Honor Code, and Student Information Form and send them along with your check, to:<br />
